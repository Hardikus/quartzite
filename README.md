# Quarzite, a thin Clojure library on top the Quartz Scheduler

Quarzite is a thin Clojure library on top the Quartz Scheduler.


## Supported Features

TBD


## Usage

Quartzite is a very young project and until 1.0 is released and documentation guides are written,
it may be challenging to use for anyone except the author. For code examples, see our test
suite.

Once the library matures, we will update this document.


## Maven Artifacts

With Leiningen:

    [clojurewerkz/quartzite "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"]

New snapshots are released to [clojars.org](https://clojars.org/clojurewerkz/quartzite) every few days.
